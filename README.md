Creating a KV Database Instance
Follow the steps outlined in the quick start guide provided by Vercel. This guide will assist you in creating and configuring your KV database instance on Vercel, enabling your application to interact with it.

Remember to update your environment variables (KV_URL, KV_REST_API_URL, KV_REST_API_TOKEN, KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN) in the .env file with the appropriate credentials provided during the KV database setup.

## Running locally
You will need to use the environment variables defined in .env.example to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use Vercel Environment Variables for this, but a .env file is all that is necessary.

Note: You should not commit your .env file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

Install Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates .vercel directory): vercel link
Download your environment variables: vercel env pull
pnpm install
pnpm dev
